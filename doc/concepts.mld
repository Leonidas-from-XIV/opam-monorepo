{1 Concepts}

An [opam-monorepo] project uses 3 components in the source tree:
- a set of opam files containing specifications about the dependencies (for
  example, a dependency on [lwt >= 4.0.0])
- a lockfile (with extension [.opam.locked]) containing references to exact
  dependencies (for example, [lwt = 4.2.1]) and how to get them (URLs, hashes,
  etc.). It also contains information about transitive dependencies, not just
  the ones mentioned in opam files.
- a [duniverse] folder, which contains the sources for all the packages
  mentioned in the lockfile

The two important commands are:
- [opam monorepo lock], which will read the Opam file and compute a solution
  using the Opam repository and the Opam solver. It will create or update the
  lockfile with this solution.
- [opam monorepo pull] will read the lockfile, download the dependencies, and
  unpack them into the [duniverse/] folder.
